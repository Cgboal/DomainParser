##### Doamin Parser

A super fast DomainParser written in Go. 

This library allows you to very quickly seperate domain names into subdomains, domains, tlds, and fqdns.

Here are some benchmarks which demonstrate the speed: 
```
â†’ go test -bench=.

As can be seen above, this parser is capable of processing 10 million DNS names in 0.399 seconds.

Example usage can be seen in the tests directory.
